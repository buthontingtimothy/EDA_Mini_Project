## EDA Mini Project

This project demonstrates skills in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by analyzing a dataset focused on airline customer satisfaction.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to identify the top 3 airline services that have the strongest correlation with overall customer satisfaction. These findings aim to provide actionable insights for enhancing customer experiences.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following features:

# Customer Details:

Gender, Customer Type, Age, Type of Travel, Class, Flight Distance

# Airline Service Satisfaction (5-Point Scale):

Inflight wifi service, Departure/Arrival time convenient, Ease of Online booking, Gate location, Food and drink, Online boarding, Seat comfort, Inflight entertainment, On-board service, Leg room service, Baggage handling, Checkin service, Inflight service, Cleanliness

# Flight Delays:

Departure Delay in Minutes, Arrival Delay in Minutes

# Final Satisfaction Outcome:

satisfaction (Categorical: "Satisfied" or "Neutral and Dissatisfied")

## Methodology

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.
Exploratory Analysis: Used statistical and visual techniques to explore relationships between variables.
Correlation Analysis: Identified features most strongly associated with final customer satisfaction.

## Key Findings

Summary of the top 3 airline services that most impact satisfaction (to be updated post-analysis).

## Tools and Technologies

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
